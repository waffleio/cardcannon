### Test your Guesses
 
By now you should have:
- Boxes 1-4 filled out on your lean canvas
- A paper prototype of a solution

So far we've made a bunch of guesses. What problems we *think* exist, what customers we *think* have that problem, and what solution we *think* would solve it.

Before moving on, we need to test those assumptions with some potential customers.
